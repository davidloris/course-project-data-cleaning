This file contains the steps taken to process the data available at:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

In order to transform it to a tidy data of 180 rows with following attributes:
- combined test and training sets
- mean values for mean and standard deviation of 67 features
- grouping by subject and activity

The script works as follows:

SETUP
- working directory is specified
- required data.table package is installed

FEATURE PROCESSING
- feature data is imported from train and test files
- feature data is combined to create a unique data frame
- feature names are extracted from features.txt
- features which are mean and standard deviation are identified
- names are applied to feature data and undesired features are removed

ACTIVITY PROCESSING
- activity data is imported from train and test files
- activity data is combined to create a unique data frame
- activity names are imported later to avoid issues in combining data

SUBJECT PROCESSING
- subject data is imported from train and test files
- subject data is combined to create a unique data frame

MERGING and RESHAPING
- feature, activity and subject data is combined using cbind
- activity_name is found by importing names and merging with data frame containing all data
- data is grouped by activity_name and subject
- the result is the tidy data set

FINAL STEP
- the data is then written to a txt file using write table


DATA 

Information on the data can be found at:

The following is an extract from this website describing how the data was gathered:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
